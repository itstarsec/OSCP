The NTLM authentication protocol consists of 7 steps.
In the first authentication step, the computer calculates a cryptographic hash called the NTLM hash from the user's password.
Next, the client computer sends the username to the server, which returns a random value called the **** or challenge.
The client then encrypts the **** using the NTLM hash, now Nonce as a response. And sends it to the server.
The server forwards the response along with the username and the **** to the domain controller.
The valication is then performed by the domain controller.
Since it already knows the NTLM hash of all users, the domain controller encrypts the challenge itself with the NNTLM hash of the supplied username
and compares it to the response it recieved from the server. If the two are equal, the authentication request is successful.
